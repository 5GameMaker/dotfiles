# dots files

Configuration & stuff.

Feel free to steal.

## Installation

To setup the OS, do `./install.sh` (Arch Linux only!)

If you just want the configs, do `./update.sh`.

Keep in mind that this will override your existing configuration so yes.

## Local mods

To append additional stuff to configs without committing, create corresponding files in `./local/`.
For files with `+ #- inject -#` in them, that line will be replaced instead.

## 3rd party content

See `./ATTRIBUTION` for all links.
